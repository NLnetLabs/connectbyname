Prototype based on libevent, use getdns for name resolution,
then connect using happy eyeballs to avoid waiting too long for a connect to
fail. Create an SSL bufferevent and wait for the buffer to become writable.
Also, send a TLSA request and verify the server key if a DNSSEC secure reply
arrives.

This prototype focusses on configuration
