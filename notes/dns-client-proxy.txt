                 Control Options For DNS Client Proxies
                      draft-homburg-dnsop-codcp-00

Abstract

   The introduction of many new transport protocols for DNS in recent
   years (DoT, DoH, DoQ) significantly increases the complexity of DNS
   stub resolvers that want to support these protocols.  A practical way
   forward is to have a DNS client proxy in the host operating system.
   This allows applications to communicate using Do53 and still get the
   privacy benefit from using more secure protocols over the internet.
   However, such a setup leaves the application with no control over
   which transport the proxy uses.  This document introduces EDNS(0)
   options that allow a stub resolver to request certain transport and
   allow the proxy to report capabilities and actual transports that are
   available.

   Do53  The original, plain text DNS transport as described in
      [RFC1034][RFC1035].  Typically, UDP is used, with the DNS server
      listening on port 53.  Sometimes, for example, for large
      responses, TCP is used, also on port 53.

   DoH  DNS over HTTPS as described in [RFC8484].

   DoT  DNS over TLS as described in [RFC7858]

   DoQ  DNS over QUIC ([RFC9000]) as described in [I-D.ietf-dprive-
      dnsoquic], not to be confused with DNS over HTTP/3 which also uses
      QUIC

2.  Introduction

   The introduction of many new transport protocols for DNS in recent
   years (DoT, DoH, DoQ) significantly increases the complexity of DNS
   stub resolvers that want to support these protocols.  In addition,
   for short-lived applications, the overhead of setting a DoH
   connection is quite high if the application only needs to send a few
   DNS requests.

   A practical way forward is to have a DNS client proxy in the host
   operating system.  A local proxy may provide some benefit to short-
   lived applications by caching results.  In particular if the system
   uses a so called 'public DNS resolver'.  In general we assume that
   the cache is tagged according to the source of a reply and the
   transport it is received on.

   This allows applications to communicate using Do53 and still get the
   privacy benefits from using more secure protocols over the internet.
   However, such a setup leaves the application with no control over
   which transport the proxy uses.  This document introduces EDNS(0)
   options that allow a stub resolver to request certain transports and
   allow the proxy to report capabilities and actual transports that are
   available.

   With respect to DNSSEC, we assume that an application that needs
   DNSSEC validation, for example, for DANE validation or SSHFP, will
   perform the DNSSEC validation within the application itself and does
   not trust the proxy.  The proxy can of course do DNSSEC validation as
   well.  Important however, is that an untrusted proxy cannot provide
   an application with a traditional (unsigned) trust anchor.

   For the transport configuration we expect three levels of details.
   The first is a choice between requiring authenticated encryption,
   also allowing unauthenticated encryption or doing opportunistic
   encryption on an best effort basis.  The second level is where the

Internet-Draft                    codcp                     January 2023


   application also specifies the names and/or IP addresses of upstream
   resolvers.  The third level is where the application also specifies
   which transports (Do53, DoT, DoH, DoQ) are allowed to be used.  A
   final transport parameter is the outgoing interface that is to be
   used.

   For authentication we can have a mix of PKIX and DANE.  Options are
   one of the two and not the other, both or one of the two.

   In a response, the proxy reports the interface, resolver, and
   transport used.

   As described in Section 3 of [RFC5625], some simple DNS proxies may
   just forward DNS packets without handling of EDNS(0) options.  So
   what could happen is that an application sends a privacy sensitive
   request to local proxy, expecting the proxy upstream connection to be
   encrypted.  However, a simple proxy may just forward the request
   unencrypted to another proxy, for example, one in a CPE that does
   implement the protocol described in this document.  So what could
   happen is that the request travels unencrypted over a local lan, or
   if proxies deeper in the network support this protocol, even further
   without the application noticing that something is wrong.

   To handle this case, we introduce an option where the proxy reports
   whether the connection between the stub resolver and the proxy is
   host-local, link-local, or site-local or global.

   In the ideal case, the host operating system provides applications
   with a secure way to access a DNSSEC trust anchor that is maintained
   according to [RFC5011].  However in situations where this is not the
   case, an application can fall back to [RFC7958].  However, for short
   lived processes, there is considerable overhead in issuing two
   HTTP(S) requests to data.iana.org to obtain the trust anchor XML file
   and the signature over the trust anchor.  For this reason, it makes
   sense to let the proxy cache this information.

4.  Description

   This document introduces three new EDNS(0) options, and one new
   response code.  This first option, called PROXY CONTROL Option,
   specifies which transports a proxy should use to connect to a
   recursive resolver.

   The second option, called PROXY SCOPE Option, reports the IP address
   scope of the connection between the application's stub resolver and
   the proxy.

   Finally, the TRUST ANCHOR Option, provides the application with a
   DNSSEC trust anchor signed by IANA.

   The BADPROXYPOLICY error is returned the proxy cannot meet the
   requirements in a PROXY CONTROL Option or the option is malformed.

   If the proxy returns a BADPROXYPOLICY error, the proxy MAY include a
   PROXY CONTROL Option that lists what the proxy can do.  For example,
   if authenticated encryption is not possible, but unauthenticated is,
   then the proxy may include an option show that.

   Z

   This sub-option gives the security contraints of the DNS transports
   that are used by the client proxy.  The U, UA, and A flags are
   mutually exclusive.  If more than one flag is set, the proxy SHOULD
   return a BADPROXYPOLICY error.  There are four possibilities:

   U = 0, UA = 0, A = 0  An effort is made to reach authenticated
      encryption, if that fails, unauthenticated encryption is tried.
      If that also fails, the proxy resorts to an unencrypted transport.
      It is an error if either or both of the P or D flags is set and
      the proxy SHOULD return a BADPROXYPOLICY error if that is the
      case.

   U = 1, UA = 0, A = 0  The proxy tries only unencrypted transports.
      It is an error if either or both of the P or D flags is set and
      the proxy SHOULD return a BADPROXYPOLICY error if that is the
      case.

   U = 0, UA = 1, A = 0  An effort is made to reach authenticated
      encryption, if that fails, unauthenticated encryption is tried.
      It is an error if either or both of the P or D flags is set and
      the proxy SHOULD return a BADPROXYPOLICY error if that is the
      case.

   U = 0, UA = 0, A = 1  The proxy only tries authenticated encryption.
      The P and D flags can be used to control which authentication
      mechanism has to be used.

   The P and D flags allow the application to require a specific
   authentication mechanism (PKIX or DANE).  The meaning of the flags is
   the following:

   P = 0, D = 0  At least one of the two mechanisms has to validate for
      authenticated encryption to succeed.

   P = 1, D = 0  PKIX validation has to succeed, the status of DANE
      validation is ignored.

   P = 0, D = 1  A DANE record has to be present and be DNSSEC valid.  A

      DANE record has a Certificate Usage Field.  For some values of
      this field (the values zero and one), DANE requires PKIX
      validation.  In those cases, PKIX validation is also required
      according to the DANE specifications.  For the values two and
      three, DANE does not require PKIX and because the P flag is zero,
      the result of PKIX validation has to be ignored.

   P = 1, D = 1  Both PKIX and DANE are required together.  For PKIX,
      this means that PKIX validation has to succeed.  For DANE it means
      that a DANE record has to be present and be DNSSEC valid.
      Validation using the DANE record has to succeed.

   Note that these two flags can only be used in combination with the A
   flag.  The proxy SHOULD return a BADPROXYPOLICY error if either or
   both of the P or D flags is set and the A flag is clear.

   TRANSPORT PROTOCOL
      A DNS transport protocol identifier.  The value 0 is used to
      specify any transport implemented by server.

   PRIORITY
      The priority of this transport relative to other transports.  The
      value 0 indicates the highest priority and 254 the lowest.  The
      value 255 is defined to mean that this protocol MUST NOT be used.

   Priorities are taken over all Proxy Control options in a DNS request.
   This allows the application to specify an explicit order (or the lack
   of order) among different upstream resolvers.

   For protocol 0 (the default list), all protocols that are explicitly
   listed in a Proxy Control option are excluded from the default list.
   In other words, when processing the default list, all explicitly
   listed protocols are excluded.

   If this sub option is not present in a Proxy Control option, then the
   proxy should assume protocol 0 at priority 128.

   Instead of defining new sub-options to store IPv4 and IPv6 address,
   this document re-uses the ipv4hints and ipv6hints.  However the
   semantics are redefined to be that these option and not hints, be are
   the actual addresses that are to be used.

   DOMAIN NAME
      domain name for authentication or resolving IP addresses.  The
      domain name is encoded in uncompressed DNS wire format.

   If the option contains a domain name but no IP addresses (ipv4hints
   or ipv6hints) then the proxy is expected to resolve the name to
   addresses.  If only addresses are specified then the proxy assumes
   that no name is known (though a PKIX certificate may include an
   address literal in the subjectAltName).  If both a name and addresses
   are specified then the proxy will use the specified addresses to
   reach the upstream resolver and use the name for authentication.

   The the option contains neither a domain name nor any IP addresses
   then the application requests the resolvers known to the proxy.

   INTERFACE NAME
      name of outgoing interface for transport connections

   An application may want to specify a DNS resolver that is reachable
   through an IPv6 link-local address.  IPv6 link-local addresses are
   special in that they require a zone to be specified, either
   explicitly or implicitly.  Typically for a link-local address that
   appears as a source or destination address, the zone is implicitly
   the zone of the link the packet travels on.  For packets that travel
   between hosts, there is no goed way to explictly specify the zone of
   a link-local address because two different hosts do not agree on zone
   names.  However, if the proxy is on the same host as the application,
   then the zone identifier for the link-local address can be specified
   in the Interface field.  For this purpose an interface name can also
   be an interface index expressed as a decimal string.

8.  Protocol Specification

8.1.  Client Processing

   A stub resolver that wishes to use the PROXY CONTROL Option includes
   the option in all outgoing DNS requests that require privacy.  The
   option should be initialized according to the needs of the
   application.  In addition the PROXY SCOPE Option can be added.  In
   requests, the Scope field is set to undefined.

   If the stub resolver receives a reply without a PROXY CONTROL Option
   included in the reply, then stub resolver has to assume that traffic
   will have Do53 levels of privacy.  Similarly, a lack of a PROXY SCOPE
   Option implies a global scope.

   If the stub resolver receives a BADPROXYPOLICY error then the proxy
   was unable to meet the requirements of the PROXY CONTROL Option.

8.1.1.  Probing

   In cases where the stub resolver expects a local DNS proxy, or where
   the stub resolver has (a limited) fall back to more private
   transports, or when the security policy of the application is such
   that is better to fail than send queries over Do53, the stub resolver
   first sends a probing query to verify that the proxy supports the
   PROXY CONTROL and PROXY SCOPE Options.

   This request queries "resolver.arpa" for SOA records.  The proxy MUST
   implement this as a Special Use Domain Name.  The actual response is
   not important.  The important part is that the proxy returns PROXY
   CONTROL and PROXY SCOPE Options as described in this document or sets
   the response code to BADPROXYPOLICY if it cannot meet specified
   policy.

Internet-Draft                    codcp                     January 2023


8.1.2.  Trust Anchor

   In the ideal case, the host operating system provides applications
   with a secure way to access a DNSSEC trust anchor that is maintained
   according to [RFC5011].  However in situations where this is not the
   case, an application can fall back to [RFC7958].  However, for short
   lived processes, there is considerable overhead in issuing two
   HTTP(S) requests to data.iana.org to obtain the trust anchor XML file
   and the signature over the trust anchor.  For this reason, it makes
   sense to let the proxy cache this information.

   If the local operating system does not provide a DNSSEC trust anchor,
   then the application can ask the proxy.  The stub resolver adds the
   TRUST ANCHOR Option with ANCHORS-XML-LENGTH and ANCHORS-P7S-LENGTH
   set to zero.  If the proxy returns both an ANCHORS-XML and an
   ANCHORS-P7S, then the application verifies the trust anchor using the
   trust anchor certificate (which needs to come with the application).

8.2.  Server Processing

   Proxies are encouraged to cache options that appear in requests under
   the assumption that a stub resolver will send multiple requests.  If
   a proxy caches DNS responses then the proxy MUST tag cached responses
   with the properties of the DNS transport.  When responding to later
   requests, the proxy returns a cached entry only if the parameters of
   the DNS transport match what is specified in the request.

   When a proxy receives a new set of requirements, the proxy compiles a
   list of addresses to connect to and a list of transports to try per
   address.  The proxy SHOULD prefer more private transports over less
   private ones.

   If the proxy cannot obtain a connection to a recursive resolver in a
   way that matches the provided policy, then the proxy sets the
   BADPROXYPOLICY response code in the reply.

   The proxy MUST implement "resolver.arpa" as a locally served zone.
   Proxies SHOULD respond to all queries with NODATA unless other
   behavior is specified in a different document.

Internet-Draft                    codcp                     January 2023


   If the proxy successfully connects to a recursive resolver and
   receives a reply, or the query is for a special use domain name that
   is handled internally in the proxy, then the proxy add a PROXY
   CONTROL Options dat details the connection to the recursive resolver
   (i.e., the U, UA, or A flag depending on encryption and
   authentication, P and or D for authenticated connections, A53, AT,
   AH2, AH3, or AQ depending on the transport (or none of those for a
   future transport).  Furthermore the proxy includes the address it
   connected to, the Domain Name if known, any Service Parameters and
   the outgoing interface name if known.

   If the proxy finds a PROXY SCOPE Option, then it calculates the scope
   from the source address.  The proxy adds a PROXY SCOPE Option to a
   reply and sets the value of Scope to the actual scope of the source
   address of the request.

   If the request contains a TRUST ANCHOR Option, then the proxy tries
   to fetch the trust anchor XML and p7s files if it does not have them
   already.  If fetching one or both fails then the proxy sets the
   corresponding length to zero.  It is not clear how long the proxy can
   cache this information.  [RFC7958] Does not describe how long these
   documents can be cache.  A simple solution is to take the Expires
   header in the HTTP reply.  The proxy adds a TRUST ANCHOR Option to
   the reply.

9.  Connection Between Stub Resolver And Proxy

   Absent other configuration, a stub resolver that implements this
   standard SHOULD connect to the proxy using Do53 and as remote address
   either ::1 or 127.0.0.1.  In particular, the stub resolver SHOULD
   avoid using name servers listed in files such as /etc/resolv.conf.

   The reason for this is to simplify the integration of local DNS
   proxies in existing environments.  If the stub resolver ignores /etc/
   resolv.conf then the proxy can use that information to connect to
   recursive resolvers.

   If no DNS server is responding to queries sent using Do53 to ::1 and
   127.0.0.1, or if the response indicates that this standard is not
   supported, then the stub resolver MAY fall back to traditional
   configuration methods, such as /etc/resolv.conf.  However, in that
   case the stub resolver MUST make sure that doing so does not violate
   the policy set by the application.

10.  Security Considerations

   A privacy sensitive application SHOULD first issue a SOA query for
   resolver.arpa to verify that the local proxy supports the options
   documented in the document.  If the proxy does not support this
   document then the application can refrain from sending queries that
   reveal privacy sensitive names.

   By setting the interface name, an application can select an outging
   interface on the proxy.  Proxies should make sure that a query
   receives from a process that is authorized to do so.  By default, a
   proxy SHOULD allow only process on the same host to use this feature.
   If an unauthorized process includes an option with the interface name
   set, then the proxy SHOULD return the BADPROXYPOLICY error.

11.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the following DNS EDNS0 option codes:

   ------- -------------- ---------- -----------
