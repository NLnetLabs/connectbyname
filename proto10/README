Prototype based on libevent, use getdns for name resolution,
then connect using happy eyeballs to avoid waiting too long for a connect to
fail. Create an SSL bufferevent and wait for the buffer to become writable.
Also, send a TLSA request and verify the server key if a DNSSEC secure reply
arrives.

This prototype focusses on Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)

This prototype needs the 'sftcd-openssl' fork of openssl, branch ECH-draft-13a
Note, getdns, ldns, libevent, and unbound also need to be compiled with
this openssl version.

This prototype needs ldns configured with the --enable-rrtype-svcb-https
option.

This prototype needs the 'philip-proxy-config' branch of getdns including
the referenced version of stubby.

This prototype also needs stubby from that branch to be running on the
same machine.
